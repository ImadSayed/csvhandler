# CSV People Uploader

The task is to provide the user with a way to upload a csv file containing a list of people attributes including title, first name, initial and last name.
The file is then uploaded to the backend and processed and then displayed on the front end by clarifying the peoples attributes.

Limitations: every entry in the csv file must have at least a title attribute and a last name attribute
